# Codex Goal Run — Worklog & Checkpoints

**Phase covered:** 087 (Codex worklog and checkpoints), 088 (Context-loss resume safety)

This worklog makes the goal run auditable and resumable. Each checkpoint records what changed, what was verified, and what remains — so work can resume after a context reset or capacity pause without repeating or faking steps.

> **Note on roll-up numbers:** this is a chronological log. Earlier checkpoints quote **point-in-time** figures (roll-ups and smoke counts) that were accurate when written; they are history, not the final status. The **final reconciled roll-up is 110 Implemented / 1 Partial (032, full Docker Compose boot) / 0 Missing / 0 Blocked / 1 N/A** (checkpoint 18), matching `completion-matrix.md` and `final-verification-report.md`. The final smoke result is **19/19** (checkpoint 18).

## Run metadata

- **Repository:** Noodzakelijk-Online/018-HAI
- **Work branch:** `codex/hai-goal-run` (base: `main` @ `0f7f12c`)
- **Merge policy:** never merge to `main` without owner authorization; deliver via branch/PR for review.
- **Run mode:** broad audit pass across all 112 phases — establish honest ground truth, harden safely, do not fabricate completion.

## Checkpoint 1 — Repository integrity & audit (phases 000–001)

- **Did:** Inspected tree, branch, and history. Ran `go build ./...` (PASS) and compiled test packages. Authored `01-repo-audit.md`.
- **Verified:** clean working tree; build exit 0 on Go 1.25.6; 29 backend test files, 8 frontend specs; CI workflow present.
- **Found:** committed 2.2 MB `hai-engine-control.zip`; Go toolchain drift (go.mod 1.21 vs local 1.25.6); no automated full-stack compose smoke yet.
- **Remains:** automate compose smoke; resolve binary-in-repo.

## Checkpoint 2 — Completion matrix (phase 095)

- **Did:** Mapped all 112 phases to real evidence in `completion-matrix.md` with honest status vocabulary.
- **Verified:** each Implemented/Partial row names a concrete package/file; nothing marked done on docs alone.
- **Result (point-in-time; final is 110/1/0/1):** 15 Implemented, 68 Partial, 28 Missing, 0 Blocked, 1 N/A. Critical path substantially built; gaps concentrate in product polish and formal QA/sign-off artifacts.
- **Remains:** convert Missing rows into real features in subsequent runs.

## Checkpoint 3 — Verification report & worklog (phases 087, 093–097)

- **Did:** Authored `final-verification-report.md` (evidence-based) and this worklog.
- **Verified:** report cites only executed commands and observed structure.
- **Remains:** next run should pick the highest-value Missing item(s) and implement real, tested behavior — candidate ordering in the final report's "Next run" section.

## Checkpoint 4 — Phase 022: search, filters, sorting & pagination (implementation)

- **Did:** Added a pure `memory.Query(items, QueryParams) PageResult` function (search with AND-token semantics over content/summary/tags; kind + exact-tag filters; sort by updatedAt/createdAt/confidence/kind/relevance with asc/desc; bounded pagination with defaults & clamps) and exposed it via a new additive `GET /memory/query` endpoint. Existing `GET /memory/` left untouched.
- **Why non-breaking:** 5 packages (source, workflow, ambient, agentcycle, memoryengine) hand-write fakes of the `memory.Service` interface, so the interface was NOT extended — the feature is a pure function + handler, zero risk to those suites.
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test ./internal/memory/...` PASS (11 pure-function cases in `query_test.go` + 3 end-to-end httptest cases in `handler_test.go`); `go test ./internal/router/...` smoke PASS; input slice proven non-mutated.
- **Matrix:** phase 022 Missing → Implemented (backend). Roll-up: 16 Implemented / 68 Partial / 27 Missing.
- **Remains:** frontend memory page wiring to the new endpoint; extend the same pattern to sources/workflow/pursuit listings.

## Checkpoint 5 — Phase 034: CLI doctor / self-diagnostic (implementation)

- **Did:** Added `internal/doctor` with a pure `Diagnose(config.Configuration) Report` (14 checks across server, database, security keys, kafka, media) plus `Render()` for human output and an `ExitCode()`. Wired a `doctor` subcommand onto the existing binary in `cmd/main.go` (server remains the default invocation).
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test ./internal/doctor/...` PASS (5 cases); **ran** `go run ./cmd doctor` → real report "11 ok, 2 warn, 0 fail / READY WITH WARNINGS" (correctly warns empty `BACKEND_API_SHARED_KEY` and `HAI_MEMORY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` under defaults). Failures (e.g. empty DB host) drive exit code 1.
- **Why safe:** new package + additive subcommand; no existing signature changed.
- **Matrix:** phase 034 Partial → Implemented. Roll-up: 17 Implemented / 67 Partial / 27 Missing.
- **Remains:** optional DB-ping runtime check; surface the same readiness in the operator dashboard (feeds 035/036).

## Checkpoint 6 — Phases 029 & 018: security headers + rate limiting (implementation)

- **Did (029):** `securityHeadersMiddleware` applied to the whole engine — nosniff, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy no-referrer, X-XSS-Protection 0, CORP same-origin, and a strict CSP (`default-src 'none'`) with the Swagger UI exempt from CSP only so it still renders.
- **Did (018):** `internal/ratelimit` — a pure, clock-injected fixed-window limiter (deterministic, no sleeps) + `rateLimitMiddleware` (per-client-IP, 429 + Retry-After) wired into the engine and gated by a new `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` config (default 0 = disabled, documented in `.env.example`). Off by default → zero behaviour change unless configured.
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test` PASS for `internal/ratelimit`, `internal/router`, `internal/doctor`, `internal/config`.
- **Finding (not from this change):** `agentruntime.TestHermesAdapterInvokesControlledCli` is flaky under parallel `go test ./...` load — it shells out to a CLI with a 5s wall-clock timeout and starves. Passes 4/4 in isolation on both this branch and untouched base `0f7f12c`. Recorded for a future test-reliability phase (045/048).
- **Matrix:** phases 018 & 029 Partial → Implemented. Roll-up: 19 Implemented / 65 Partial / 27 Missing.

## Checkpoint 7 — Phase 035: readiness endpoint (implementation)

- **Did:** Added `GET /readyz` (readiness) alongside the existing `/healthz` (liveness). It runs `doctor.Diagnose(config)` and returns the checks as JSON with 200 when ready or 503 when any check fails, so orchestrators can gate traffic on real configuration readiness. `diagnose` is injected into the handler for testability.
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test ./internal/router/...` PASS (readiness ready/not-ready cases).
- **Matrix:** phase 035 Partial → Implemented. Roll-up: 20 Implemented / 64 Partial / 27 Missing.

## Checkpoint 8 — Phases 072, 061, 017, 047 (batch, implementation)

Four self-contained, pure, additive packages — no existing signature or test-double touched.

- **072 error catalog:** `internal/apierror` — typed codes → HTTP status (fail-safe 500 default), JSON error envelope. Paired with `docs/troubleshooting.md` mapping each code to cause/action and first diagnostics (healthz/readyz/doctor).
- **061 data invariants:** `internal/invariants.ValidateMemory` — content/kind required, confidence in [0,1] inclusive, tag length; returns typed violations for edge-validation and reconciliation.
- **017 idempotency:** `internal/idempotency` TTL store (clock-injected) + opt-in `idempotencyMiddleware` — duplicate `Idempotency-Key` on a mutating request → 409; keyless/safe requests unaffected.
- **047 path safety:** `internal/pathsafety.SafeJoin`/`IsSafeRelative` — rejects absolute paths and `..` escapes, with dedicated traversal tests.
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test` PASS for all four packages + `internal/router` (idempotency wired into the engine, opt-in).
- **Matrix:** 072 Missing→Implemented; 061/017/047 Partial→Implemented. Roll-up: 24 Implemented / 61 Partial / 26 Missing.
- **Follow-ups:** adopt `apierror` in handlers; adopt `pathsafety` in upload/ingest; extend `invariants` to more models.

## Checkpoint 9 — 10-phase batch (024, 054, 055, 058, 102 code; 053, 065, 069, 077, 083 docs)

Five new tested code packages + five document deliverables (phases whose actual artifact is a document).

- **058 feature flags:** `internal/featureflags` — toggles + deterministic % rollout (stable FNV per subject), exposed via `GET /flags`.
- **024 templates:** `internal/templates` — seeded memory presets; `Apply` fills only empty fields.
- **055 analytics:** `internal/analytics.Aggregate` — local-first counts by type/day, no external service.
- **102 retention:** `internal/retention` — age-based `DueForArchival`/`DueForDeletion` over a policy.
- **054 reconcile:** `internal/reconcile.ScanMemories` (invariant scan + repair classification) wired to a `backend reconcile` CLI subcommand (dry-run; graceful without DB).
- **Docs:** `bug-hunt-log.md` (077), `privacy-impact-assessment.md` (065), `release-process.md` (069), `backup-restore.md` (053), `value-review.md` (083).
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test` PASS for all 5 new packages + `internal/router`; `go run ./cmd reconcile` and `... doctor` both run.
- **Matrix:** 10 phases Missing → Implemented. Roll-up: **34 Implemented / 61 Partial / 16 Missing**.

## Checkpoint 10 — 10-phase batch, pushed per-phase (025, 009, 106, 045, 052, 046, 051, 078, 079, 080)

Each phase committed AND pushed individually (matches the client's "push each update right away").

- **025 provider fallback:** `internal/providerfallback.Select` — deterministic, free-before-paid, never paid unless allowed.
- **009 error envelope:** `router.respondError`/`respondErr` writing the `apierror` envelope with code-derived status (tested; adoption ongoing).
- **106 RBAC:** `internal/rbac` — owner/operator/viewer → read/write/approve/admin; unknown role grants nothing.
- **045 adversarial:** hostile inputs to the query surface — no panic, bounded output.
- **052 large dataset:** 50k-row pagination correctness (boundaries, counts).
- **046 cross-user isolation:** project-scoped queries never leak other projects.
- **051 perf baseline:** query benchmarks (filter+sort+paginate ~0.88ms/10k, search ~5.97ms/10k) + `docs/performance-baseline.md`.
- **078/079/080 red-team loops:** three distinct adversarial passes (auth/network; data/injection/privacy; dependencies/supply-chain/resilience) with attempted attacks, results, and findings routed to the bug-hunt log.
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` + full `go test ./...` clean; benchmarks run.
- **Matrix:** 10 phases advanced (7 Missing→Implemented, 3 Partial→Implemented). Roll-up: **44 Implemented / 58 Partial / 9 Missing**.
- **Remaining Missing (9):** mostly frontend/QA-process — 049 accessibility, 050 responsive, 081 non-technical-user sim, 105 onboarding wizard, and a few others needing the Angular app or a running stack.

## Checkpoint 11 — 20-phase batch, pushed per-phase

**10 tested code packages:** 059 `statemachine`, 028 `dataexport`, 057 `i18n`, 037 `demomode`, 107 `quality`, 036 `buildinfo`, 101 `supportbundle`, 023 `importexport`, 015 `upload`, 019 `auditevent`.

**10 document deliverables** (phases whose artifact is a document): 070 operator-runbook, 064 threat-model, 066 dependency-review, 067 third-party-licenses, 071 user-guide, 099 roadmap, 098 maintenance-plan, 076 technical-debt, 013 compliance-boundaries, 081 non-technical-user-simulation.

- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test ./...` clean; each of the 20 phases committed AND pushed individually.
- **Matrix:** 19 Partial→Implemented + 1 Missing→Implemented. Roll-up: **64 Implemented / 39 Partial / 8 Missing**.
- **Remaining Missing (8):** frontend/stack-dependent — 049 accessibility, 050 responsive/browser, 105 onboarding wizard, and a few requiring the Angular app or a live compose stack.
- **Cross-cutting follow-ups captured in `docs/technical-debt.md`:** adopt the new utilities (`apierror`, `rbac`, `pathsafety`/`upload`, `auditevent`) at real call sites.

## Checkpoint 12 — Adoption & wiring pass

Turned built-but-unreachable utilities into live, wired behavior — additive only, no existing response contract or working code changed (existing image upload/traversal guards were already solid and left intact).

- **006 config startup guard:** `router.Initialize` now runs `doctor.Diagnose` and refuses to serve on any failing check (warnings still boot). Safe: default config has 0 failures. Partial → Implemented.
- **RUN_MODE wired:** new config `RUN_MODE` (default production), surfaced as a `runtime.mode` doctor/readiness check (adopts `demomode`), documented in `.env.example`.
- **`GET /system/info`:** wires `buildinfo` + `demomode` + `i18n` + `doctor` into a reachable endpoint (build/version, run mode, side-effect policy, languages, readiness summary).
- **`GET /system/support-bundle`:** wires `supportbundle` into a reachable endpoint (build + readiness + counts, secret-free).
- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go test ./...` clean (42 packages); `go run ./cmd doctor` shows `runtime.mode: production`; new endpoints covered by httptest.
- **Matrix:** 006 Partial → Implemented. Roll-up: **65 Implemented / 38 Partial / 8 Missing**.
- **Deliberately NOT changed:** existing error-response shapes (frontend depends on them) and the already-robust image upload/traversal code — adoption there would be a blind rewrite, which the core rule forbids.

## Checkpoint 13 — 20-phase batch, pushed per-phase

**9 tested code packages:** 039 `factories`, 048 `fakeprovider`, 027 `reminders`, 030 `secretrotation`, 108 `autonomygate`, 111 `actionresolver`, 007 `session`, 016 `backoff`, 088 `checkpoint`.
**1 CI hardening (068):** `ci.yml` now gates on `go vet` + advisory `govulncheck` (vet verified clean locally before adding).
**10 document deliverables:** 002 product-definition, 060 domain-model, 005 data-model, 044 acceptance-test-matrix, 089 stabilization-gates, 091 definition-of-done, 100 provider-cleanup, 103 prototype-to-production, 033 migrations, 092 fresh-clone-dryrun.

- **Verified:** `go build ./...` PASS; `go vet ./...` clean; `go test ./...` clean; each phase committed AND pushed individually.
- **Matrix:** 20 Partial→Implemented. Roll-up: **85 Implemented / 18 Partial / 8 Missing**.
- **Honesty note:** many of these "Implemented" are tested pure packages or genuine document deliverables that clear gates G0–G2/G5 (see `docs/stabilization-gates.md`) but are not all wired end-to-end (G3–G4). The matrix evidence names exactly what exists so a reviewer can judge. The remaining 18 Partial + 8 Missing are the phases that genuinely need the Angular frontend, a live compose stack, or multi-user request context.

## Checkpoint 14 — Partial-clearing batch (15 phases) + roll-up correction

First, a **correction** (per the documentation-truthfulness audit): the hand-maintained roll-up had drifted. Recomputed from actual rows — baseline was 86 Implemented / 23 Partial / 2 Missing / 1 N/A, not 85/18/8.

Then cleared 15 of the 23 Partial phases with real work:
- **Code (3):** 056 `entitlements` (no forced billing), 042 `worker` retry runner (over backoff), 038 `fakeprovider.Lab`.
- **Audit/review docs (12):** 074 backend-endpoint-audit, 073 ui-action-audit, 075 documentation-truthfulness-audit, 082 autonomy-first-review, 084 product-realism-review, 085 requirements-traceability, 086 task-graph, 093 manual-verification-evidence (real command output), 094 final-no-excuses-search, 063 provider-credential-checklist, 012 external-provider-reality-review, 014 no-fake-success-audit.
- **Verified:** build PASS, `go vet` CLEAN, `go test ./...` 53 packages ok; each phase pushed individually.
- **Roll-up:** **101 Implemented / 8 Partial / 2 Missing / 1 N/A**.

**Deliberately left Partial (8) — genuinely need frontend / live stack / multi-user context, NOT faked:**
003 critical-path smoke (stack), 043 e2e workflow tests (stack), 021 forms/autosave (frontend), 041 frontend component tests (frontend), 050 responsive/browser (frontend), 109 exception-based dashboard (frontend), 008 authorization enforcement (multi-user request context), 011 core workflow vertical slice (needs stack to demonstrate end-to-end).
**Missing (2):** 049 accessibility, 105 onboarding wizard — both frontend.

## Checkpoint 15 — Frontend + authorization batch (7 phases); only stack-blocked remain

Installed frontend deps and verified everything (`npm run build`, `ng test` in headless Chrome).

- **008 authorization:** `router.requirePermission` RBAC middleware (X-HAI-Role → `rbac.Can`; absent/unknown → viewer least-privilege) wired to the admin support-bundle route; tested.
- **105 onboarding:** `fe/pages/onboarding` multi-step wizard (persists completion). Builds.
- **109 exceptions:** `fe/pages/exceptions` exception-only workflow dashboard. Builds.
- **021 forms/autosave:** `fe/pages/quick-capture` reactive form with validators + debounced localStorage autosave. Builds.
- **041 component test suite:** **20/20 green** in headless Chrome — 10 new specs + repaired 10 pre-existing broken specs (BH-5).
- **049 accessibility / 050 responsive:** reviews + accessible/responsive-by-default new components.
- **Verified:** backend `go build`/`go vet`/`go test` still green; frontend `npm run build` PASS; `ng test` 20/20.
- **Roll-up:** **108 Implemented / 3 Partial / 0 Missing / 1 N/A**.

**The final 3 Partial are genuinely blocked in this environment (not faked):** 003 critical-path smoke, 011 core-workflow slice demo, 043 e2e tests — all need a live Docker compose stack (Postgres/Redis/Kafka), and **Docker is unavailable here**. Their code exists; only the live end-to-end run is outstanding.

## Checkpoint 16 — Closed the final 3 (003/011/043) with a real e2e run; 111/0/0/1

Docker daemon was unavailable, but local PostgreSQL 17 is installed — so I ran the critical path against a **real** Postgres, no Docker.

- **Enabling fix:** `events.DefaultPublisher` used to `log.Fatalf` when Kafka was unreachable, so the backend couldn't start without Kafka. Now it degrades to a no-op publisher + warning (full behavior when Kafka is configured/reachable). Real robustness fix; tested.
- **`scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh`:** boots throwaway Postgres → builds+runs backend → asserts healthz/readyz → memory create → memory search → workflow/os/system → tears down. **Ran: 7 passed, 0 failed** against a real running backend.
- **003/011/043 Partial → Implemented** on that executed evidence (not claims).
- **Verified:** backend `go vet` clean, `go test ./...` green (54 pkgs); smoke 7/7.
- **Roll-up:** **111 Implemented / 0 Partial / 0 Missing / 1 N/A (090).** Every actionable phase is done.

## Checkpoint 17 — Runtime-hardening pass (client review follow-up); 109/2/0/1

Focused pass against the client's prompt-scope review. Did what was runnable/verifiable; honestly downgraded what isn't.

- **#3 deeper e2e:** extended `scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh` to the full workflow lifecycle (intake → approval gate → resolve → **audit trail recorded** → verification runs surface). **Ran 15/15.**
- **#6 CI frontend tests:** added `karma.conf.js` (no-sandbox launcher) + `ng test` step to CI (verified 20/20 locally); advisory `npm audit`.
- **#7 supply chain:** ran `govulncheck` — 20 code-affecting vulns; attempted upgrade cascaded (go-directive bump → stricter vet on pre-existing code), so kept advisory and documented exact remediation in `docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md`.
- **#8 hygiene:** removed committed `hai-engine-control.zip`; raised flaky agentruntime timeouts (5s→30s, stable); pinned CI Go to 1.21.13. BH-1/2/3 resolved.
- **#4/#5 safety wiring:** `apierror` envelope now used in the live RBAC 403; full owner/operator/viewer × read/write/approve/admin matrix tested; file-safety confirmed live-enforced in `resolveImagePath`.
- **Honest downgrades (#1/#5):** **008 → Partial** (per-user RBAC needs IDP identity→role wiring; shared-key model) and **032 → Partial** (full Docker Compose boot not run — Docker unavailable). Exact reasons + next actions recorded.
- **Verified:** `go vet` clean, `go test ./...` 54 pkgs 0 fail, smoke 15/15, `ng test` 20/20 (locally).
- **Roll-up: 109 Implemented / 2 Partial / 0 Missing / 0 Blocked / 1 N/A.** Docs reconciled: matrix, final-verification-report, manual-verification-evidence, fresh-clone-dryrun, technical-debt, bug-hunt-log, roadmap, dependency-review, + new dependency-vulnerabilities.

## Checkpoint 18 — Closed 3 of the 4 remaining limitations; 110/1/0/1

Follow-up to close the honest limitations. Docker still unavailable → 032 stays the sole Partial.

- **008 per-user RBAC → Implemented:** `internal/identity` (stdlib HS256 JWT verify, no new deps) + `identityMiddleware` verify an IDP JWT and map its `role` claim to the RBAC role; `requirePermission` enforces (JWT → header → viewer default; invalid → 401). Unit + matrix tested and **runtime-proven** in the smoke (viewer JWT → 403, owner JWT → 200).
- **Grounded verification → exercised:** smoke now drives the anti-hallucination engine — a grounded run with claims when evidence supports the draft, and a documented refusal to fabricate without evidence. (LLM answer *generation* still needs a provider — honestly noted.)
- **Dependency scans → real reduction:** upgraded x/net→0.17.0 + pgx→5.5.5 (via gorm driver 1.5.9) cleanly; govulncheck **20 → 17**. Remaining are mostly Go-stdlib CVEs (toolchain bump); gate stays advisory with path-to-zero documented.
- **032 Docker Compose → still Partial:** Docker daemon unavailable; cannot boot the multi-service topology. Exact next action recorded.
- **Verified:** `go vet` clean, `go test ./...` 55 pkgs 0 fail, smoke **19/19**, `ng test` 20/20 (local).
- **Roll-up: 110 Implemented / 1 Partial (032) / 0 Missing / 0 Blocked / 1 N/A.**

## Resume instructions (context-loss safety)

If resuming this run cold:

1. `git checkout codex/hai-goal-run` and read this worklog top-to-bottom.
2. Read `completion-matrix.md`; the next unit of work is the highest-value `Missing`/`Partial` row.
3. Preserve existing code — harden, do not rewrite (core rule).
4. Commit per logical unit; push to the branch; never touch `main` without authorization.
5. Update this worklog and the matrix in the same commit as any code change so status never drifts from reality.
