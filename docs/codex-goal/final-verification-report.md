# Final Verification Report — Codex Goal Run

**Phases covered:** 093 (Manual verification evidence), 094 (Final no-excuses search), 096 (Final verification report), 097 (Final response requirements)
**Date:** 2026-07-08 (final, post-implementation)
**Base:** `main` @ `0f7f12c` → work delivered via PR #13 (merged)

Per phase 097, this report is evidence-based: commands actually run with their results, what was produced, honest limitations, blocked items, and a secrets confirmation. It reflects the **final post-implementation state** — this document supersedes the earlier docs-only audit snapshot.

## 1. Scope of this run

The run began as a broad audit pass and then **implemented across the full 112-phase program**, phase by phase, committing and pushing each unit with passing tests. The core rule was held throughout: *no mockups, no fake integrations, no false completion* — every "Implemented" row in the completion matrix cites a concrete file, endpoint, or executed test.

## 2. Commands run and results (verification evidence)

| Command | Purpose | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `go version` | toolchain | `go1.25.6 darwin/arm64` |
| `go build ./...` (backend) | build | **PASS** (exit 0) |
| `go vet ./...` (backend) | static analysis | **CLEAN** |
| `go test ./...` (backend) | full unit suite | **54 packages ok, 0 failures** |
| `find backend -name '*_test.go'` | backend test surface | **78** files |
| `go run ./cmd doctor` | config self-diagnostic | `12 ok, 2 warn, 0 fail` → READY WITH WARNINGS |
| `go run ./cmd reconcile` | data integrity CLI | runs (dry-run; graceful without DB) |
| `npm run build` (frontend) | Angular production build | **PASS** |
| `ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless` | frontend unit suite | **20/20 SUCCESS** (headless Chrome) |
| `find frontend/src -name '*.spec.ts'` | frontend test surface | **11** files |
| `scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh` | critical-path + workflow lifecycle + grounded verification + per-user JWT RBAC | **19/19 passing** — see §5 for scope |
| `govulncheck ./...` | dependency vuln scan | after upgrade: **17** code-affecting vulns (was 20; x/net + pgx fixed) — advisory, see `docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md` |

## 3. What was produced

This run added real, tested product source (not just docs):

- **~32 new backend Go packages** (all unit-tested): e.g. memory query/search, `doctor`, `ratelimit`, `idempotency`, security headers, `apierror`, `invariants`, `pathsafety`, `featureflags`, `templates`, `analytics`, `retention`, `reconcile`, `providerfallback`, `rbac`, `statemachine`, `dataexport`, `i18n`, `demomode`, `quality`, `buildinfo`, `supportbundle`, `importexport`, `upload`, `auditevent`, `factories`, `fakeprovider`, `reminders`, `secretrotation`, `autonomygate`, `actionresolver`, `session`, `backoff`, `checkpoint`, `entitlements`, `worker`.
- **New reachable API surfaces:** `/readyz`, `/memory/query`, `/flags`, `/system/info`, `/system/support-bundle`, plus security-headers/rate-limit/idempotency middleware and an RBAC-guarded admin route.
- **Frontend:** onboarding wizard, exception dashboard, quick-capture form (built + spec-tested); repaired 10 pre-existing broken specs so the suite is green.
- **Robustness fix:** `events.DefaultPublisher` no longer crashes the process when Kafka is unreachable (degrades to a no-op publisher).
- **Tooling & CI:** `scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh` (extended to the workflow lifecycle), CI now hard-gates `go vet` + build + test + **frontend unit tests (headless Chrome, `karma.conf.js`)** + compose-config validation, with advisory `govulncheck` + `npm audit`; Go pinned to 1.21.13.
- **Per-user authorization:** `internal/identity` (stdlib HS256 JWT verify, no new deps) + `identityMiddleware` map a verified IDP JWT's `role` claim to the RBAC role; enforced and runtime-proven.
- **Dependency security:** upgraded `golang.org/x/net`→v0.17.0 and `pgx`→v5.5.5 (via `gorm/driver/postgres`→v1.5.9); code-affecting vulns 20 → 17, no regression.
- **Robustness/hygiene this pass:** Kafka producer degrades gracefully; flaky `agentruntime` CLI test timeouts raised (stable); committed 2.2 MB `hai-engine-control.zip` removed; RBAC 403 adopts the apierror envelope; CI adds frontend headless tests + advisory `npm audit`; Go pinned to 1.21.13.
- **Docs:** the full `docs/codex-goal/` sign-off set plus operator/security/QA documents.

## 4. Honest status summary

- **Roll-up: 110 Implemented · 1 Partial · 0 Missing · 0 Blocked · 1 N/A (090, a process rule).**
- **The 1 remaining Partial is an honest environment limit:** **032 Docker readiness** — Dockerfiles/compose/config-validation present, but a full multi-service `docker compose up` boot was not executed here (Docker daemon unavailable). Exact next action recorded. *(008 Authorization moved to Implemented this pass — per-user identity→role is now wired via verified IDP JWTs and runtime-proven; see §3.)*
- The critical path (dashboard → source → task → LLM routing → approval → controlled execution → verification → workflow → audit) is implemented and was exercised end-to-end against a real database (§5).
- **Honest nuance:** several "Implemented" phases are tested utility packages/documents that are not yet wired into *every* call site (e.g. `apierror`, `rbac`, `pathsafety`/`upload`, `autonomygate`, `actionresolver`). This is tracked openly in `docs/technical-debt.md`, and each matrix row's evidence states exactly what exists.

## 5. Known limitations of this report (what was and was NOT run)

**Was run:** the smoke (`scripts/smoke-critical-path.sh`) booted a **real local PostgreSQL 17** and the compiled backend, and asserted **19/19** — `healthz`, `readyz`, memory create → persist → search, the system/os surfaces, the **workflow lifecycle** (intake → approval gate → approval resolved → **audit trail recorded**), the **grounded-verification engine** (a run with claims when evidence supports the draft, and a documented refusal to fabricate when it does not), and **per-user JWT RBAC** (viewer JWT → 403, owner JWT → 200 on the admin route).

**Was NOT run (honest boundary):**
- The **full Docker Compose multi-service stack** (Postgres + Redis + Kafka + nginx together) was **not** booted — the Docker daemon was unavailable in this environment. The smoke used a standalone local Postgres, and **Kafka was degraded to a no-op** (Redis was not exercised). So compose-topology behavior (event publishing, gateway routing) is not covered by an executed test here.
- **Live external providers** (Gmail/Drive/Calendar/paid LLMs) were not exercised — intentionally disabled in code.
- **LLM answer *generation*** (task planning) was not exercised — no LLM provider is configured. The deterministic **grounded-verification engine** (evidence → claim checking, anti-hallucination) **was** exercised in the smoke; only free-text generation via a provider remains.
- **Dependency scans are not yet a blocking gate** — 17 code-affecting vulns remain (mostly Go-stdlib, needing a toolchain bump). Path to zero + flip-to-blocking is in `docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md`.

## 6. Blocked items

**None.** No phase is blocked by external credentials or human account actions. Real-provider integrations remain intentionally disabled in code (paid budget €0, connectors gated) — a deliberate safety posture, not a blocker.

## 7. Secrets confirmation

No secrets, credentials, tokens, API keys, private databases, or generated user data were committed. Config changes were limited to non-secret template entries in `.env.example` (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `RUN_MODE`). The smoke script generates a throwaway database and tears it down; it commits nothing.

## 8. Recommended next work

1. Run the **full Docker Compose** stack end-to-end (with Docker available) to cover event publishing + gateway routing that the local-Postgres smoke cannot.
2. **Adopt the tested utilities at their call sites** (`apierror` envelope in handlers, `rbac` enforcement on more routes, `pathsafety`/`upload` on all file I/O) — converts "tested capability" into "wired everywhere". Tracked in `docs/technical-debt.md`.
3. Make the dependency scans **blocking** gates after the coordinated dependency + toolchain + vet upgrade in `docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md`.
4. Run the full Docker Compose stack on a Docker-capable host and assert `/readyz` green across services — the only remaining Partial (032). *(Per-user identity → role RBAC was completed this run: verified IDP JWT → role, enforced and runtime-proven.)*
